welcome to cowshu's patented piracy kit v1.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(most, if not all, software is FOSS (Free and Open Source Software). 
This means the software is 99% of the time completely safe, and community-made.)
(If you still do not trust the software, I have provided links to the software's github pages)
(usage of spotify clients listed below in all categories has the (low) possibility of getting your spotify account banned, as its against spotifys rules, idk about youtube/youtube music tho)

	Dependencies (Software required for specific apps)

(Android) YouTube Revanced Extended:
https://github.com/inotia00/VancedMicroG

	Android Apps

- YouTube Revanced Extended:
https://github.com/NoName-exe/revanced-extended

- xManager (Spotify):
https://github.com/xManager-v2/xManager-Spotify

Lucky Patcher (hack mobile games, resist freemium):
https://www.luckypatchers.com/ 
(note taht there are many impersonators of luckypatchers.com giving out malicious versions of the app. this is the real site, and can be trusted!)
(please also note that Lucky Patcher is commonly detected as malware, however it is not. It gets flagged this way due to it injecting it's own code into other apps, however this behavior can only be initiated by the user, with their consent and full knowledge of what they are doing. Note that patching using this app could get you punished by the app/game's moderation (you can remove ads get free in-app purchases and more). I am unaware if you can get punished on any Google services like google play games, but be cautious.) (Hey! I recently found some games may not even start if the luckypatcher package is found on your phone. I tried to play Cookie Run: KIngdom, but it only would start after I uninstalled LP.)

	Desktop Apps

- SpotX (Spotify):

- YouTube Music th-ch:
